# OS Simulation

Welcome to the OS Simulation project! This is a C++ project designed to simulate the intricacies of modern operating systems. It includes threading, semaphores, shared memory, and advanced scheduling algorithms.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the OS Simulation project on your system:

### Prerequisites

1. **Linux Environment**: Make sure you are using a Linux-based operating system.

2. **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/os-simulation.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.

### Configuration

1. Review the project's source code to understand the various components of the OS simulation, including threading, semaphores, shared memory, and scheduling.

2. Make any necessary adjustments or configuration changes based on your requirements.

### Usage

1. Build and run the project.

2. Explore the OS simulation to gain insights into process management, inter-process communication, and dynamic thread scheduling.
